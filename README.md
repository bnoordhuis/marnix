# MARNIX

This is MARNIX, a UNIX clone.

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Easy as pie but make sure that you're on a GNU/Linux system:

    make clean all

## HOW TO RUN

I would recommend against running MARNIX on real hardware for now. :-)

Install [qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) and run it like this:

    make qemu

## KNOWN BUGS

Too numerous to list. It's a work in progress.
